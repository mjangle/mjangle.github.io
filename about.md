<p>My name is Matthew Angle</p>

<p> Iâ€™m enrolled as a student at Shippensburg University with an expected graduation in May 2021. I currently work for The Beistle Company as a Software Engineering Intern.</p>

<p>I previously worked for the Shippensburg University Engineering Department as support for our system administrator. I love working with Linux and Python. Most of my personal projects revolve around Linux or Python.  
I enjoy most things related to data science, including scraping/sourcing, transforming, and interpreting data.</p>


<p>In my personal time I enjoy spending time with my family, cooking (esspecially BBQ), and
watching hockey.
