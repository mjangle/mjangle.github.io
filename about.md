<p>My name is Matthew Angle</p>

<p>I’m currently enrolled as full-time student at Shippensburg University, where I’m working on my senior research 
which involves augmenting medical image datasets with GAN based synthetic images to improve CNN accuracy.</p>

<p>I previously worked for the Shippensburg University Engineering Department as support for our system administrator. 
I love working with Linux and Python. Most of my personal projects currently revolve around Linux or Python.  
I enjoy most things related to data science, including scraping/sourcing, transforming, and interpreting data.</p>


<p>In my personal time I enjoy spending time with my family, cooking (esspecially BBQ), and
watching hockey. I'm a Flyers fan.
